#### Summary

This is the front-end of a project developed using `React`. The project aims to serve as a manager and analyzer for the execution of activities and habits.

The main libraries used in the project were `react-router-dom`, `nivo`, `axios`, `zod`, `react-hook-form`, and `radix`.

The project complements the back-end by serving as the interface for users to interact with all the data manipulated on the server side.

>The motivation behind the project is to have a quantitative control over how much effort you are putting into maintaining a certain habit. Studies show that the more you push yourself to perform an activity beyond your limit, the more likely you are to stop doing it. Therefore, it is important to focus on gradual improvement and slow down when necessary. For example, when starting the habit of reading, it is important not to start by reading a book a day but to gradually increase the number of pages per day.
